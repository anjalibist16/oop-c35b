     // 2. Extend/Modify the above program to print two additional lines:
     // This is my first program
    // I am on module ST4003CEM
    // System.out.print (not println) and produces the same output.
    System.out.print("This is mu first program\n");
    System.out.print("I am on module ST400CEM");
//  3. Write a program that prints the following output:
// A "quoted" String is
// 'much' better if you learn
//  the rules of "escape sequences."
// Also, "" represents an empty
// String. Don't forget: use \"
// instead of " !
// '' is not the same as "

    System.out.println("A \"quoted\" String is\n");
    System.out.println("'much' better if you learn\n");
    System.out.println("the rules of \"escape sequences.\"\n");
    System.out.println("Also, \"\" represents an empty\n");
    System.out.println("String. Don't forget: use \\\"");
    System.out.println("instead of \" !\n");
    System.out.println("'' is not the same as ");
// 4. WAP that prints the following pattern:
// *
// **
// ***
// ****

System.out.println("*");
System.out.println("**");
System.out.println("***"); 
System.out.println("****"); 
// 5. WAP prints the following pattern:
// *********
// *********
// *********
// *********
System.out.println("*********");
System.out.println("*********");
System.out.println("*********");
System.out.println("*********");

// 6. WAP that prints the following output:
// A well-formed Java program has a main method with { and } braces.
// A System.out.println statement has ( and ) and usually a String that starts and ends with a " character.(But we type \" instead!)
// What is the difference between
// a ' and a "?  Or between a " and a \"?
// One is what we see when we're typing our program. The other is what appears on the "console."

     System.out.print("\n\nA well-formed Java program has a main method with { and }\nbraces.\n\n\n");
     System.out.println("A System.out.println statement has ( and ) and usually a\nString that starts and ends with a \" character.\n");
     System.out.println("(But we type \\\" instead!)\n\nWhat is the difference between\na ' and a \"? Or between a \" and a \\\"?\n\n\n\n");
     System.out.println("One is what we see when we're typing our program. The other is what\nappears on the \"console.\"\n\n");
